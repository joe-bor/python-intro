# Python Notes

## Multiple Assignments

- this also works if assigning diff data types

```py
a, b, c, d = 1, 2, "3", ["x", "z"]
```

## List Comprehensions

- dig DEEPER on this one in the future
- basically 1 liner for simple list transformations

```py
# creates a list[] of 1-10 raised to the power of 2
squares = [x**2 for x in range(1,11)]

```

## Slicing

- built-in slicing for lists and strings

```py
my_list =  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
first_three = my_list[:3]
```

## Destructuring Assignments

- swap values w/o using a temp variable

## Default ARgument Values

## \*args and \*\*kwargs
